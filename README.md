# Kard Theme 

Custom App for Frappe V12 that modifies the desktop as well as some other css changes.

* Option to add User Desktop Shortcuts as in v11. With the ability to sort and hide.
	* Shortcuts can be of type doctype or report or custom link.
* Option to add a sidebar with a list of allowed modules.
* Option to add a grid of icons consisting of allowed modules.
* Option to hide the current v12 Desktop Cards.
* Adds a “Add to Desktop” link in the User Dropdown
    * Only shows for doctypes, pages and reports.


## Notes

Frappe v11 used a doctype called desktop_icon to store user shortcuts, their order and standard shortcuts as well as icon appearance information.

This theme stores this info in a custom doctype called kard_desktop_icon.

Frappe v12 uses config files to determine what cards show on the desktop and what links/sections show on the module view page. 

This theme uses kard_desktop_icon instead of config files. Adding an entry with type “module” and checked as standard will show as an icon on the module grid/sidebar and will have a module view page.

The module view page shows all doctypes belonging to that module and displays them in sections.
